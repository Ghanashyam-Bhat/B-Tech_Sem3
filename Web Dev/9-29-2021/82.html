    5.With JS we use AJAX Function XMLHttpRequest() to request the server
    6.by using JQuery we can write AJAX with less no. of lines,
        ->  $.ajax()
        ->  $.get()    -- used to send data between the server and client
                        while using "get" we should not send any sensitive data
        ->  $.post()   -- used to send data between the server and client
                        while using "post" we can send sensitive data
        -> $.getjson()
