		<h1>Image Tag usage</h1>
		
		<!--   <img src = "  " alt = " ">  -->
		<!-- That is the syntax of image tag
		This doesnt have opening and closing. Hence it is called inline tag -->
		<!-- Giviing alt is optional, this is a text to be loaded if image is not displayed properly-->
		
		<!-- In src we need to give image name with extension -->
		
		<img src = "File name not there" alt = "Image of animal">
		<!--We can ignore setting width and height, then default size will be given to image-->
		<p>The above image is not loaded, hence name will be displayed</p>
		<img src = "2Image.jpg" alt = "Image of Nature" width="50%" height=50%	>
		<!-- We can change width and height also
		We can change height and width pixel by pixel by pixel or by percentage -->
		<img src = "1Image.jpg" alt = "Image of Nature" width=650px height="320px">
		<!--Size can be mentioned inside " " or without " ". It is giving same results-->
		<!--Giving height and width in terms of % is always better, because it will fit better in all devices-->
		
		<img src = "https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxlJ7VzD3XBc&psig=AOvVaw0A7Jxq4bO_7YgjSnQg5UCs&ust=1629972110140000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCNDdhbn1y_ICFQAAAAAdAAAAABAM" alt = "Spiderman No way home" width="650" height="320px"	>
		<!--To display image directly from internet-->
		
		<!--While using pixel, we can also avoid px. It will give same result -->
		<img src = "/E:../Installed Applications/Xampp/htdocs/3_sem/Image/3Image.jpg" alt = "Image of Nature" width="50%" height=50%	>
		<!--To take image from root path-->
